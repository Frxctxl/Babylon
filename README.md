# Babylon

## Description
Babylon is an Express.js app that uses a PostgresQL relational Database to facilitate product management for companies. This is an api, meaning it can be accessed from anywhere as long as they can access the database URL. This allows companies to just get a URL and store all data in one place, where anyone can use it.

## Installation
Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Frxctxl/Babylon.git
```
Inside, take the desired database's URL(your-db) and run
```bash
export DB_URL="<your-db>"
```
then download node dependencies and start with
```bash
npm i
node server.js
```
